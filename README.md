# st - suckless terminal

st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less. This fork has the following patches applied by default, check [st.suckless.org](https://st.suckless.org/) for more info.

- [scrollback](https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/)
- [bold is not bright](https://st.suckless.org/patches/bold-is-not-bright/)
- [boxdraw](https://st.suckless.org/patches/boxdraw/)


## Requirements

In order to build st you need the Xlib header files plus, consider to install [some patched font](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/.dotfiles/tree/master/themes/.local/share/fonts) since the default one is `mononoki Nerd Font`.


## Installation

First clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/matteogiorgi/st.git
```

Then edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into the `/usr/local` namespace by default). Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if necessary as root):

```
make clean install
```


## Running st

If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile the st terminfo entry with the following command:

```
tic -sx st.info
```
